Design cues taken from the <a href="https://github.com/fghibellini/arch-silence">Arch-Silence theme by Filippo Ghibellini</a>

### Fonts

Fonts are the shortcoming of most Grub themes, this is a limitation with Grub itself, which uses the
ppf2 font format which lacks any kerning whatsoever. Fonts can be converted with grub-mkfont, but the
results are highly variable.  

Anyone who has suggestions to improve the overall look of the fonts, particularly in the minimalist theme, please shoot me a message.
